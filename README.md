# Moire Animation

** STILL IN DEVELOPMENT **

Create moire animations in processing that you can export and print.

You can view the animation in screen, but there are still things to do.

To show-hide stripes change:
```
// SHOW:
boolean show_lines = true;

// HIDE:
boolean show_lines = false;
```

### TO DO LIST:
- Implement the GUI control panel
- Show - hide stripes
- Export merged image and export stripes
